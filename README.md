# Credify
fake Social media detection with the help of "Graphical Neural Network"

## How It Works

1. Graph Construction  
   User nodes are connected based on interactions (likes, follows, comments).

2. Feature Engineering  
   Features include post frequency, follower/following ratio, activity time gaps, etc.

3. Model Training  
   The GCN learns to classify accounts using node features and graph structure.

4. Prediction  
   The model predicts whether an account is fake or genuine.
